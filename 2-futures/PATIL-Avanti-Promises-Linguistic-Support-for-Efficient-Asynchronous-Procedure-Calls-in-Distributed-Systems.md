Avanti Patil <patil.av@husky.neu.edu>

## Synopsis
This paper deals with the concept of `Promises`: a new data type designed to support asynchronous remote procedure call mechanism to be used by components of a distributed program. It briefly describes `call-stream`: language-independent communication mechanism and examples of streams integrated in Argus programming language. The paper further goes on to describe how promises can be used with forks of local processes and compare mechanism presented in paper to related ones in other languages. It ends with brief on stream composition and evaluation of presented mechanism.
